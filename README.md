# Bookbot

A simple project in the curriculum of [Boot.dev] (https://www.boot.dev) to get my hands dirty and practice Python basics. 

The program takes a path towards a local book in a text file format and outputs a simple lexicographical analysis on:
* The number of words
* The number of occurrences of each alphabetical character
